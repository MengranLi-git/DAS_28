## Methods:

-  EDA (summarize, density plot, scatter plot, correlation)

-  Linear regression, model diagnosis

-  Model selection: step AIC

-  Model comparison: adjusted R2, AIC and BIC as criterion

-  Bootstrap to select variables significant at 0.95, obtain the 95% CI of parameter estimations and their distributions.
