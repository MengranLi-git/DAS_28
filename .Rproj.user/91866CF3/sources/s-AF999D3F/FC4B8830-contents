# Introduction {#sec:Intro}
Public transport is necessary for most Scotlands. Therefore, its comfort and customer satisfaction are important for operators. To help improve public transport, The purpose is to discover factors having correlation with passengers' satisfaction in this project.
The data are from Scotlandâ€™s official statistics. The theme of Transport contains seven datasets, Road Transport Expenditure, Public Transport, Road Vehicles, Concessionary Travel Cards, Road Network and Traffic, Travel to Work and Other Purposes. There are 460 observations of 24 variables in this research.


# Exploratory Data Analysis {#sec:EDA}
The research is based on a poll by the Scottish Household Survey (SHS). 
The whole dataset, combined from seven datasets obtained from website of Scottish government statistics, has 24 factors and 460 observations. 
The explanatory variables are Road Casualties, Road Transport Expenditure, Public Transport, Road Vehicles, Concessionary Travel Cards, Road Network and Traffic and Travel to work and other purposes.

# Formal Data Analysis {#sec:FDA}
Linear regression model, a model for examining and discovering relations between response variable and explanatory variable(s), is applied in this project. The formula is presented below:
\\begin{equation}y=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+\\dots+\\beta_px_p+\\varepsilon \\label{eq:(1)} \\tag{1} \\end{equation}
where y is the response variable, $x_1$ to $x_p$ is the number of columns selected from 1 to p, $\beta_0$ is the intercept of data, $\beta_1$ to $\beta_p$ is the coefficients of corresponding columns of X from 1 to p. The $varepsilon$ is the error terms of the estimations.
A total of four regressions were performed. First, all the independent variables were regressed, and then the highly correlated factors were sequentially removed, and finally four models were obtained.
step AIC method is applied as a certeria for model selection. 
model 2 is the best choice.
Using Bootstrap to select significant variables at 95% level and obtain its confidence interval of parameter estimation and their observations.This process should be repeated 1000 times.
